# Build with AI Sri Lanka 2026 — Voice Agent

A voice AI assistant that answers questions about **Build with AI Sri Lanka 2026**, hosted by GDG Sri Lanka in partnership with Hatch and BuildrLabs — Saturday, July 25th 2026, from 9 AM at Hatch Works, Colombo.

Ask it when and where the event is, what the two tracks cover, what's on the agenda, or when a particular speaker is on. Built with [LiveKit Agents for Python](https://github.com/livekit/agents) and [LiveKit Cloud](https://cloud.livekit.io/).

The project includes:

- A voice assistant grounded in the real event schedule, with two tools:
  - `lookup_agenda` — the published sessions for either track, or both at once when someone asks about a person
  - `submit_question` — takes an audience question for the live Q&A. **This one is a stub**: it records questions in memory and always reports success. Point it at the event's real Q&A before using it on the day
  - All event facts live in [src/event_info.py](src/event_info.py) — edit the agenda there and both the prompt and the tool pick it up
  - Tested to answer from the published schedule, to refuse to invent sessions, speakers, times, or ticket prices, and never to answer on a speaker's behalf
- A speech-to-speech pipeline built on the [Gemini Live API](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/models/realtime/plugins/gemini/)
  - Uses Gemini 3.1 Flash Live, which consumes and produces speech directly instead of transcribing to text and back, preserving tone and other verbal cues while removing a round trip of latency
  - Swap in any other [realtime model](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/models/realtime), or an STT-LLM-TTS pipeline with more than 50 models via [LiveKit Inference](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/models/inference), through the extensive plugin ecosystem
- Eval suite based on the LiveKit Agents [testing & evaluation framework](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/start/testing/)
- Turn detection handled by the Gemini Live API's own server-side VAD. This model is not compatible with the [LiveKit Turn Detector](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/logic/turns/turn-detector/); see the note next to `turn_handling` in [src/agent.py](src/agent.py) for the trade-off and how to get it back
- [Background voice cancellation](https://docs.livekit.io/transport/media/noise-cancellation/)
- Deep session insights from LiveKit [Agent Observability](https://docs.livekit.io/deploy/observability/)
- A Dockerfile ready for [production deployment to LiveKit Cloud](https://docs.livekit.io/deploy/agents/)

This starter app is compatible with any [custom web/mobile frontend](https://docs.livekit.io/frontends/) or [telephony](https://docs.livekit.io/telephony/).

## Using coding agents

This project is designed to work with coding agents like [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code), [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/), and [Codex](https://openai.com/codex/).

For your convenience, LiveKit offers both a CLI and an [MCP server](https://docs.livekit.io/reference/developer-tools/docs-mcp/) that can be used to browse and search its documentation. The [LiveKit CLI](https://docs.livekit.io/intro/basics/cli/) (`lk docs`) works with any coding agent that can run shell commands. Install it for your platform:

**macOS:**

```console
brew install livekit-cli
```

**Linux:**

```console
curl -sSL https://get.livekit.io/cli | bash
```

**Windows:**

```console
winget install LiveKit.LiveKitCLI
```

The `lk docs` subcommand requires version 2.15.0 or higher. Check your version with `lk --version` and update if needed. Once installed, your coding agent can search and browse LiveKit documentation directly from the terminal:

```console
lk docs search "voice agents"
lk docs get-page /agents/start/voice-ai-quickstart
```

See the [Using coding agents](https://docs.livekit.io/intro/coding-agents/) guide for more details, including MCP server setup.

The project includes a complete [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) file for these assistants. You can modify this file to suit your needs. To learn more about this file, see [https://agents.md](https://agents.md).

## Dev Setup

Create a project from this template with the LiveKit CLI (recommended):

```bash
lk cloud auth
lk agent init my-agent --template agent-starter-python
```

The CLI clones the template and configures your environment. Then follow the rest of this guide from [Run the agent](#run-the-agent).

<details>
<summary>Alternative: Manual setup without the CLI</summary>

Clone the repository and install dependencies to a virtual environment:

```console
cd agent-starter-python
uv sync
```

Sign up for [LiveKit Cloud](https://cloud.livekit.io/) then set up the environment by copying `.env.example` to `.env.local` and filling in the required keys:

- `LIVEKIT_URL`
- `LIVEKIT_API_KEY`
- `LIVEKIT_API_SECRET`
- `GOOGLE_API_KEY`

The Gemini Live API is used through a plugin rather than LiveKit Inference, so it needs its own key. Get one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey). To use a Vertex AI model with a service account instead, see the note next to `GEMINI_LIVE_MODEL` in [src/agent.py](src/agent.py).

You can load the LiveKit environment automatically using the [LiveKit CLI](https://docs.livekit.io/intro/basics/cli/):

```bash
lk cloud auth
lk app env --write --destination .env.local
```

</details>

## Run the agent

Run this command to speak to your agent directly in your terminal:

```console
uv run python src/agent.py console
```

To run the agent for use with a frontend or telephony, use the `dev` command:

```console
uv run python src/agent.py dev
```

In production, use the `start` command:

```console
uv run python src/agent.py start
```

## Frontend & Telephony

Get started quickly with our pre-built frontend starter apps, or add telephony support:

| Platform | Link | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|

| **iOS/macOS** | [`livekit-examples/agent-starter-swift`](https://github.com/livekit-examples/agent-starter-swift) | Native iOS, macOS, and visionOS voice AI assistant |
| **Flutter** | [`livekit-examples/agent-starter-flutter`](https://github.com/livekit-examples/agent-starter-flutter) | Cross-platform voice AI assistant app |
| **React Native** | [`livekit-examples/voice-assistant-react-native`](https://github.com/livekit-examples/voice-assistant-react-native) | Native mobile app with React Native & Expo |
| **Android** | [`livekit-examples/agent-starter-android`](https://github.com/livekit-examples/agent-starter-android) | Native Android app with Kotlin & Jetpack Compose |
| **Web Embed** | [`livekit-examples/agent-starter-embed`](https://github.com/livekit-examples/agent-starter-embed) | Voice AI widget for any website |
| **Telephony** | [Documentation](https://docs.livekit.io/telephony/) | Add inbound or outbound calling to your agent |

For advanced customization, see the [complete frontend guide](https://docs.livekit.io/frontends/).

## Tests and evals

This project includes a complete suite of evals, based on the LiveKit Agents [testing & evaluation framework](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/start/testing/). To run them, use `pytest`.

```console
uv run pytest
```

## Using this template repo for your own project

Once you've started your own project based on this repo, you should:

1. **Check in your `uv.lock`**: This file is currently untracked for the template, but you should commit it to your repository for reproducible builds and proper configuration management. (The same applies to `livekit.toml`, if you run your agents in LiveKit Cloud)

2. **Remove the git tracking test**: Delete the "Check files not tracked in git" step from `.github/workflows/tests.yml` since you'll now want this file to be tracked. These are just there for development purposes in the template repo itself.

3. **Add your own repository secrets**: You must [add secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/writing-workflows/choosing-what-your-workflow-does/using-secrets-in-github-actions) for `LIVEKIT_URL`, `LIVEKIT_API_KEY`, and `LIVEKIT_API_SECRET` so that the tests can run in CI.

## Deploying to production

This project is production-ready and includes a working `Dockerfile`. To deploy it to LiveKit Cloud or another environment, see the [deploying to production](https://docs.livekit.io/deploy/agents/) guide.

## Self-hosted LiveKit

You can also self-host LiveKit instead of using LiveKit Cloud. See the [self-hosting](https://docs.livekit.io/transport/self-hosting/local/) guide for more information. If you choose to self-host, you'll need to also use [model plugins](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/models/#plugins) instead of LiveKit Inference and will need to remove the [LiveKit Cloud noise cancellation](https://docs.livekit.io/transport/media/noise-cancellation/) plugin.
